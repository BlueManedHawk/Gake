# Gake

**This is not intended to be a big, professional project.  This is just some silly thing I made because I thought it would be neat.  Please do not expect the same level of professionalism found in big projects from this project.**

Gake is an open-source reimplementation of Google Snake, with some extensions.  If I'm going to be honest, the main reason for this is to create a platform for determining algorithmic solutions to the game of Snake for various extensions to the game.  This isn't really intended as an actual game, though I'll try to make it like one anyway.

To make interaction with the game for the purpose of performing these algorithmic solutions possible, I've decided that the game will have an API, for some reason.  (Why did I think this was a good idea again?).

The game will include all of the behavior present in Google Snake for release vI.0; after that, I'll add some other extensions, such as arbitrary grid sizes, weird bounds (a la Golly's bounded grids for cellular automata), and other stuff.

More details will follow as I get the project done.
