# Makefile for Gake.  This is terrible, but it's better than the previous one.  These things are incomprehensible magic.

# This is designed to be used with GNU Make.  Please do not take this as praise of the FSF:  it's just what I had.

# The comments of this file assume that you understand makefiles.  If you don't, read the wikipedia page, then use the GNU Make reference manual _as-needed_.

# Oh, also, this assumes knowledge of ANSI escape sequences.  You can just use the Wikipedia page; the official standard is a nightmare to navigate and contains a lot of pointless boilerplate.
