# Makefile for Gake.  This is terrible, but it's better than the previous one.  These things are incomprehensible magic.

# This is designed to be used with GNU Make.  Please do not take this as praise of the FSF:  it's just what I had.

# Oh, also, this assumes knowledge of ANSI escape sequences.  You can just use the Wikipedia page; the official standard is a nightmare to navigate and contains a lot of pointless boilerplate.

# Compiling a debug target works by recompiling the Main file with a macro `GAKE_DEBUG` defined.  The headers included in the Main file check to see if this macro is defined, and depending on whether it is, expose or don't expose certain functions.  This means that to make a debug build, _only_ the main file needs to be recompiled, instead of all of the files.  (Did that make sense?  I sure hope so.)
