# Notes on licensing

**THIS IS NOT A LEGALLY BINDING DOCUMENT, AND DOES NOT OVERRIDE THE LICENSE ITSELF.**

The license allows for commercial use.  This is because prohibiting commercial usage is the wrong way to dismantle crapitalism, as it does more harm to thosw who suffer from it than to those who benefit from it.

The requirements to not suggest authoral condonement is something I don't really see too much.  I don't know why.

To be clear:  Any software that uses the API is yours.  You can license it however you wish, though I would _highly_ recommend copylefting it.

Because the total number of possible rule files is so small, and because people will inevitably end up arriving at the same conclusions, I decided to put them all implicitly into the public domain.

I explcitly stated the lack of warranty and the disclaimer of liability because there's no way that I, as an individual, would be able to properly keep such warranties, and because putting such a warranty in would also mean that contributors would need to also agree to it, which would end up gatekeeping contibutions (and would be rude).
